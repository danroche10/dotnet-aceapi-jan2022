# Acebook API

This is the starter for the ASP.NET Core 5 Acebook API exercise.

The seed comes with an API partially implemented, including authentication and a
simple `Posts` resource. There is no frontend, as this will be built by another
team â€” your job is purely the backend API.

In this module, you'll first do some [Investigation
Exercises](./INVESTIGATION.md), and then move onto the
[PROJECT.md](./PROJECT.md).

## Quickstart

```shell
# Check dotnet CLI is installed
; which dotnet
/usr/local/share/dotnet/dotnet
# If you get 'dotnet not found', go install .NET Core

; dotnet test # Run tests, if all good keep going
; dotnet watch run # To run the dev server

# To run the linter
; dotnet tool install --global dotnet-format
; dotnet-format --check -w -sa info
```
